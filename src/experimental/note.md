- deprecate paths2sections(paths) -> rails2sections(rails)
- deprecate path_scaling_sections(shape_pts, edge_path) -> rail_extruded_sections(shape_pts, rail)
- deprecate hull_polyline2d, hull_polyline3d -> polyline_join
- deprecate shape_starburst, shape_pentagram -> shape_star
- deprecate starburst -> polyhedra/star

- angle_between adds a ccw param.
